# Description

## Problem to solve
1. The Mobile Pomodoro "Start" button is lazy (just emojis), described as "whack".
2. The Bottom Matrix (Mobile Footer) uses generic emojis (`🗄️`, `🎯`) that clash with the app's "Paper/Hand-drawn" aesthetic.

## Solution
1. **Pomodoro Timer**: Replace header-variant buttons with styled, non-emoji controls (CSS/SVG).
2. **Bottom Matrix**: Replace emojis with custom inline SVGs (or CSS shapes) that match the "scribble/paper" theme (e.g., Folder/Box and Target/Eye).

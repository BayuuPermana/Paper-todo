# Research: Mobile Header Timer Customization

**Date**: 2026-01-19

## 1. Executive Summary
The `PomodoroTimer` component has two variants: `full` and `header`. The `header` variant, used on mobile, lacks the preset selection buttons available in the `full` variant.

## 2. Technical Context
- **src/PomodoroTimer.jsx (line 67)**: The `header` variant currently only renders the time display and toggle/reset buttons.
- **src/PomodoroTimer.jsx (line 4)**: `PRESETS` constant defines the available times [15, 25, 45, 60].

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- There is enough space in the 60px mobile header to include a small selector.
- A `<select>` element might be the most space-efficient, but mini-buttons (`15`, `25`, etc.) would match the "Paper" aesthetic better.
- Need to ensure `setSelectedPreset` is called correctly from the new UI element.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Mobile header is compact; UI must not overflow.
- Style must match existing "Paper" buttons.

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- State `selectedPreset` is already available in the component scope.
- `header` variant is a conditional return inside `PomodoroTimer`.

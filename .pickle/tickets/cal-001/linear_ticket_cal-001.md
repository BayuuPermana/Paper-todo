# Description

## Problem to solve
The app needs a high-level temporal overview that fits the tactile "Paper" look.

## Solution
- Create a `PaperCalendar` component (God Mode).
- Display a small, top-right calendar.
- Highlight current date.
- Style with hand-drawn lines, Comic Sans/handwritten fonts, and paper textures.

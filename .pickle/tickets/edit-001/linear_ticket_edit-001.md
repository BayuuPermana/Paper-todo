# Description

## Problem to solve
We need to ensure that the inline edit input fields look like hand-drawn text entry areas and handle focus/blur events correctly without "AI Slop."

## Solution
Research CSS patterns for transparent backgrounds, bottom-only borders, and hand-drawn fonts in inputs. Map the React state transitions for entering/exiting edit mode.

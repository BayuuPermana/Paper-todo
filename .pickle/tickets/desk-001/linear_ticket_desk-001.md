# Description

## Problem to solve
We need to determine the best CSS approach to keep the right segment static while the left scrolls, without breaking the "Paper" aesthetic or creating vertical margin issues.

## Solution
Research `vh` calculations, `overflow-y` behaviors on flex/grid items, and how to maintain the container's shadow and borders while content scrolls internally.

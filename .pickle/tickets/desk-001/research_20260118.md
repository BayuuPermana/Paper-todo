# Research: Fixed-Height Layout & Scroll Mechanics

**Date**: 2026-01-18

## 1. Executive Summary
Implementing a "Stationary Desk" requires shifting the scroll context from the global viewport to the specific content segment. The main container must be constrained to the viewport height to ensure symmetrical margins are maintained and the tools on the right remain static.

## 2. Technical Context
- **Current Container**: `.paper-container` (Lines 11-24) uses `display: grid`. It grows with content.
- **Current Scroll**: Handled by the `body` element.
- **Margins**: `body` has `padding: 50px 0` (Line 9).

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- **Container Height**: To keep the container "seen fully," its height should be fixed. `height: calc(100vh - 100px)` ensures it fits between the body's top and bottom padding.
- **Internal Scrolling**: `.left-segment` needs `height: 100%` and `overflow-y: auto`. This isolates the scroll to the task list.
- **Right Segment**: Since the parent grid item `.paper-container` no longer grows, the `.right-segment` will stay in the viewport without needing `position: sticky`.
- **Symmetry**: `align-items: center` on the `body` should be combined with `height: 100vh` to ensure perfect centering if the container is smaller than the screen, but since we want it "seen fully" even when large, a fixed height based on `vh` is safer.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **Box Shadows**: Internal scrolling can sometimes clip box shadows. Padding adjustment on the segments may be needed.
- **Mobile Breakpoint**: At `< 1024px`, the grid stacks. The fixed height and internal scroll should likely be disabled on mobile to allow natural document flow.

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- Current: Document-level scrolling.
- Required: Component-level scrolling for the left pane; static right pane.

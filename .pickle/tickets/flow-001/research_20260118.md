# Research: Focus Burnout & Flow Mode Mechanics

**Date**: 2026-01-18

## 1. Executive Summary
Research indicates that the human brain operates best in 90-minute ultradian cycles. Conventional Pomodoro (25/5) is good for overcoming procrastination but inefficient for deep work (Flow). "Flow Mode" should allow users to exceed the timer without interruption, while the "Burnout Shield" must enforce recovery after 90 minutes of continuous or high-density focus.

## 2. Technical Context
- **Existing Logic**: `src/PomodoroTimer.jsx` uses a simple `setInterval` countdown.
- **State Persistence**: No current persistence for timer history.
- **Affected Components**: `PomodoroTimer.jsx`, `App.jsx` (if we need global lockout state).

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- **The Flow Buffer**: Flow state usually activates after 15-20 minutes. Interrupting at 25 minutes kills the state.
- **The 90-Minute Ceiling**: Cumulative focus time exceeding 90 minutes without a significant break (>15 mins) leads to cognitive fatigue.
- **Technical Mapping**:
    - **Presets**: 15 (Quick Task), 25 (Standard), 45 (Deep Work), 60 (God Mode).
    - **Flow Mode**: When countdown hits zero, transition state to `FLOWING` and count *up*.
    - **Burnout Shield**: Track total seconds focused in a `totalFocusTime` variable. Reset if a gap of >15 mins occurs. Lock `Start` button if `totalFocusTime >= 5400` (90 mins).

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **State Management**: React `useState` and `useEffect` are sufficient, but we must handle background tab behavior (timers can drift).
- **Aesthetic**: The "Paper" container must visually reflect the state (e.g., yellow glow for Flow, red warning for Burnout).

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- Current: Stateless timer (resets on reload).
- Required: Semi-persistent timer state (history tracked in `localStorage` to survive accidental reloads).

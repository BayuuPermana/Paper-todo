# Description

## Problem to solve
We need a scientific basis for "Burnout Protection" and "Flow Mode" to ensure the implementation actually helps the user rather than just being annoying.

## Solution
Research optimal focus intervals, the transition into flow states, and the biological necessity of breaks. Map these findings to a technical implementation plan.

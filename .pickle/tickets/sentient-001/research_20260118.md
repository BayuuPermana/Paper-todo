# Research: Math-Synthesized Acoustic Engine

**Date**: 2026-01-18

## 1. Executive Summary
Tactile feedback in digital environments increases user immersion and "flow." Synthesis via the Web Audio API is the most efficient method, requiring no assets and providing zero-latency response. We will implement a singleton audio engine capable of generating 'Paper' and 'Pencil' textures on demand.

## 2. Technical Context
- **Web Audio API**: Standard browser interface for audio processing.
- **Current State**: Application is silent.
- **Affected Components**: `App.jsx`, `TaskSidebar.jsx`, `SubTaskItem.jsx`.

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- **Sound of Pencil**: 
    - Base: White noise.
    - Filter: High-pass (freq ~2000Hz).
    - Envelope: Attack 0.01s, Decay 0.1s, Sustain 0.05s, Release 0.05s.
- **Sound of Rustle**: 
    - Base: Brown or Pink noise (lower energy high frequencies).
    - Filter: Band-pass (freq ~500Hz - 1500Hz).
    - Envelope: Slow attack/release to simulate movement.
- **Sound of Crumple**: 
    - Base: White noise.
    - Envelope: Rapid fire bursts (10-20ms each) over 0.5s.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **User Interaction**: Modern browsers block audio until the first user click. We must initialize the `AudioContext` inside a click handler.
- **Performance**: Synthesis is lightweight but should be managed via a singleton to prevent multiple contexts.

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- Utility: `src/utils/GodAudio.js`.
- Interface: `playPencil()`, `playRustle()`, `playCrumple()`.

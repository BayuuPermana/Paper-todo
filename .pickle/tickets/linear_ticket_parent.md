# Description

## Problem to solve
The app is currently a single column. Users need a more "desk-like" experience where they can see their tasks and productivity tools side-by-side.

## Solution
Split the UI into two segments:
- Left (2/3): Tasks and Subtasks.
- Right (1/3): Pomodoro Timer and Calendar.
Implement subtask-linked timer logic.

# Product Guidelines - Paper-todo

## Voice & Tone
- **Empathetic & Encouraging:** The app should speak like a supportive friend. Language should acknowledge that starting is the hardest part.
- **Supportive Language:** Use phrases like "Small steps lead to big wins," "You've got this," and "One thing at a time."
- **Celebratory:** Acknowledge every bit of progress, no matter how small, to build momentum and combat procrastination.

## Visual Identity & Design Principles
- **Calm Palette:** Focus on soft, non-intrusive colors. Use off-whites (#F9F9F9), warm grays, and muted pastels for categories or accents to prevent visual overstimulation.
- **Negative Space as Focus:** High use of white space to isolate tasks and reduce "visual noise," helping the user focus on the current item.
- **Approachable Typography:** Use clean, readable fonts that feel human and approachable, rather than strictly "corporate" or "system-default."

## Behavioral Guidelines (Messaging & Motivation)
- **Incremental Encouragement:** Provide gentle positive feedback when tasks are broken down into sub-tasks, reinforcing the behavior of decomposition.
- **Peaceful Zero-States:** When the list is empty, present a tranquil "clear desk" aesthetic that rewards the user with a sense of mental space.
- **Anti-Shame Design:** Eliminate stressful visual cues like red "Late" badges or urgent sirens. Tasks should never feel like they are "scolding" the user. Use neutral, patient language for pending items.
- **Low-Friction Interactions:** Ensure every action feels smooth and "analog" to maintain the user's flow and prevent frustration-induced abandonment.

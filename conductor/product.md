# Product Guide - Paper-todo

## Initial Concept
Anyone that have procrastination or overwhelmed by big tasks problems.

## Target Audience
- Individuals struggling with procrastination or who feel overwhelmed by the scale of their responsibilities.
- Users seeking a tool that helps lower the barrier to starting and completing tasks through psychological relief and simplicity.

## Primary Goal
- **Overwhelming Task Mitigation:** Reduce user anxiety and paralysis by facilitating the breakdown of large, daunting projects into small, achievable atomic steps.
- **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Provide a focused environment that prevents "decision fatigue" often caused by complex project management tools.

## Key Features
- **Sub-task Breakdown:** Advanced nesting capabilities allowing users to decompose "big" tasks into a checklist of manageable actions, making progress tangible and less frightening.
- **Satisfying Completion Mechanics:** High-feedback visual cues for task completion (like "paper-like" strikethroughs or rewarding animations) to provide immediate dopamine hits and a sense of accomplishment.
- **Tactile Drag-and-Drop:** Intuitive ordering via `react-beautiful-dnd` to prioritize work without overwhelming menus or configuration.

## User Experience & Aesthetic (The "Paper" Philosophy)
- **Minimalist Design:** A clean, "white space" heavy interface with simple typography to minimize mental clutter and environmental noise.
- **Physical Mimicry:** Interactions that feel grounded in reality, such as "scribbling out" completed items or "crumpling/discarding" deleted ones to make digital management feel as approachable as a physical notepad.
- **Tactile Visuals:** Subtle use of shadows, textures, and depth to create an approachable, familiar, and "non-technical" atmosphere that lowers the psychological barrier to use.
